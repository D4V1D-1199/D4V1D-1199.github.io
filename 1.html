    <h1>Fire and Ice: </h1>
    
<p> by Robert Frost <p>
    
    <p>  Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
Some say in ice.<br>
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
But if it had to perish twice,<br>
I think I know enough of hate<br>
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great<br>
And would suffice. </p>
